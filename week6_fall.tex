\textit{PUFatt: Embedded Platform Attestation Based on Novel Processor-Based PUFs}
\indent		\begin{itemize}
            \item \textit{Attestation} Built-in technology against malicious codes.

            \item \textit{Prover and Verifier} Platform to be evaluated and another platform
            to demonstrate that prover is in a known and trustworthy state.

            \item \textit{PUF} Physically Unclonable Functions

            \item \textit{Challenge and response} To each given input, there is a unique hard-
            ware specific output.

            \item \textit{CRP} Chaellenge and Response Pairs

            \item \textit{Arbiter} Two inputs gate. If one signal is faster then the other, output
            is one, vice versa.

            \item \textit{Main idea} The idea is to use process variation to create a signauture
            as the difference between to identical circuits.  The info is stored with obfuscation 
            network inside memory. The CRP for security check is verified by machine learn scheme
            based on the pre-stored info.

            \item \textit{critics} In the side channel attack, the author did not specificly explain
            what kind of side channel attack he is talking about. I believe that side channel attack
            can be acheived by bypassing the obsfucation part.
