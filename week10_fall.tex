\textit{A completely on-chip switched-capacitor DC-DC Converter using digital
capacitance modulation for LDO replacement in 45nm CMOS}
\indent		\begin{itemize}
            \item \textit{motivation} Traditional LDO can not be applied to low
            voltages such as voltages below 1.2 voltages. The capacitors can be
            applied for such low voltages. The caps occupies a large area on
            chip so it is not poplular.
            \item \textit{DCM} Digital Capacitance Modulation
            \item \textit{main idea} The author has allowed coarse tuning and
            fine tunning to achieve LDO. THe frequency is determined by the
            load. The author claimed the efficiency is more than $i60\%$.
        \end{itemize}


\noindent \textbf{Nov 4,2014}
\textit{A Sub-1 V Transient-Enhanced Output-Capacitorless LDO Regulator With
Push-Pull Composite Power Transistor}
\indent		\begin{itemize}
            \item \textit{motivation} The proposed idea uses the nondominant
            parastic poles that can push the working frequency higher.
            \item \textit{Get rid of oscillation} Get rid of high-impedance
            points in the loop.
            \item \textit{Benefits} The only difference is that the author
            implimented the entire design with a ClassA power amplifier instead
            of a regular current source, which is the push part of the circuit.
            \item {Critics} The LDO regulation starts too slow.
