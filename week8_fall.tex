\textit{Hardware Trojan Detection through Golden Chip-Free Statistical Side-Channel Fingerprinting}
\indent		\begin{itemize}
                \item \textit{Utilize the Process Control Monitors} The monitors exists on the area
                        in-between die or on the die for process characterization.
                \item \textit{Non-linear Regression Models} The way to learn side-channel fingerprints
                        using Monte-Carlo simulation.
                \item \textit{Tail Modeling Methods} Enhance classification boundary.
                \item \textit{Critics} Use math models to enhance detection rate but without any 
                        real chips.
                \item \textit{main idea} Establish a systematic way to build up a multi-dimension
                        space area, where it is very easy to define a hyper-space region, which you
                        can tell which point is trojan free. All the axes are the side-channel factors.
                \item \textbf{our work concern} The HTs are added by reverse engineering. The problem 
                        is that if we add antennas, they will be discovered in the reverse engineered
                        part. And they are easily modified by adding those antenna cells.
