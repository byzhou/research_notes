\textit{Invasive PUF Analysis}
\indent		\begin{itemize}
            \item \textit{main motivation}
            The paper is similar to the work that we have done. They are using
            the laser as the stimulation and try to detect the HT by testing the
            response. The difference is that they are focusing on the material
            level and we are working on the circuit level. They also try to find
            a way to have photonic stimulation but with electric response, which
            I think that it is a cool idea that can be explored in the future.

            \item \textit{main idea}
            The main work has been done in the area of SRAM PUF. The technique
            has been divided into two part. One part is the
            optical-stimulation-electric-response and the other is to use
            optical technique to detect the stored info inside the SRAM.
            
            The most awesome part of this paper is the idea of OSER. Once the
            laser has been applied on the gate, the gate can be turned on. With
            this technique, the idea can be used in gate-by-gate testing.

            \item \textit{critics}
            The author has met some problems to apply the idea. The main issue
            is that what we are dealing with is digital circuit. The shot
            current will lead to noise ground that make it hard to detect the
            electrical response. My first order idea to solve this idea is to
            encode the stimulation. The electrical response must be processed in
            digital region.
